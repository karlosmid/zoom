Demonstration of GraphQL and Absinthe.

To start:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * `cd assets && npm install`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

After that, proceed to [`http://localhost:4000/graphiql`](http://localhost:4000/graphiql) where you will see the GraphiQL dev environment, and explore.

It's a good idea to have 2 windows open, one with the normal view, and the other with GraphiQL.
